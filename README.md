# exif-frame-cli

A command-line interface tool for extracting EXIF data and creating frames from images.

## Features

Creates instant camera-style frames for digital photos using EXIF metadata. The tool extracts and displays the following information on photo frames:

- **Camera Model** - The camera used to take the photo
- **Lens Information** - Lens model and specifications  
- **Focal Length** - The focal length setting used
- **Aperture (f-stop)** - The f-value/aperture setting
- **Shutter Speed** - The exposure time
- **ISO Sensitivity** - The ISO setting used

This mimics the information typically printed on instant camera photo frames, giving your digital photos a nostalgic instant camera aesthetic.
